      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>DPS Sports Complex uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the
        integrity and security of your personal information and implement your privacy settings. However, We cannot
        guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat Our security measures or use your
        personal information for improper purposes. In the event where you believe your privacy has been breached,
        please contact Us immediately.</p>
      <p>We want to reduce loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, destruction, harassment,
        and abuse related to Our Platform, but We cannot guarantee complete perfection. When there is clear evidence of
        any of the above, We will do Our best to respond promptly. You acknowledge that you provide your personal
        information at your own risk.</p>
      <p>We may transfer the information described in this Privacy Policy to, and process and store it in, India and
        other countries, some of which may have less protective data protection laws than the region in which you
        reside. Where this is the case, We will take appropriate measures to protect your personal information in
        accordance with this Privacy Policy. We will take steps to reasonably ensure that the receiving jurisdiction has
        in place a standard of protection accorded to personal data that is comparable to the protection under India's
        data protection laws.</p>
      <p>We may sub-contract processing activities to third parties includeâ€”record keeping, data analysis, marketing
        assistance, processing payments, and providing customer service.</p>
      <p>You undertake to treat your password and other confidential information in relation to the use of Our Platforms
        and its Services confidentially, and We disclaim any liability arising from your failure to do so.</p>
      <p>The collection, storage, usage, and sharing of your data by the Company shall be in compliance with the
        Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information)
        Rules, 2011 and other applicable laws.</p>

        applications, however, We shall not be responsible for any breach of security or the disclosure of personal data

      <h2>Platform Permission</h2>
      <p>Most mobile platforms such as iOS, Android, etc. ("<span class="highlight">Mobile Platform</span>") have
        defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent. And these Mobile Platforms
        have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. For example, the iOS platform will alert you the
        first time the Mobile Application wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or
        not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the Mobile Application
        seeks before you first install or use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent.</p>

      <h3>Information We receive from others:</h3>

        including:</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Other users:</span> Other users may provide information about you as they use Our
        services. For instance, We may collect information about you from other users if they contact Us about you or
        ask Us to send a payment link to complete the payment transaction in relation to any booking made on Our
        Platforms.</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Social media:</span> You may be able to use your social media login (such as Facebook
        login) or Google login to create and log into your DPS Sports Complex account on the Platform. This saves you
        from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share some information from your
        social media account with Us.</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Other partners:</span> We may receive information about you from Our partners, for
        instance where DPS Sports Complex ads are published on a partner's websites and platforms (in which case they
        may pass along details for instance information in connection with a campaign's success).</p>
      <p>When you use Our Secondary Services, We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of providing our
        Secondary Services to you. Instead, your messages are stored on your device and not typically stored on our
        servers. Once your messages are delivered, they are deleted from our servers. The following scenarios describe
        circumstances where we may store your messages in the course of delivering them:</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Undelivered Messages.</span> If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example,
        if the recipient is offline), we keep it in encrypted form on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver
        it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it.</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Media Forwarding.</span> When a user forwards media within a message, we store that
        media temporarily in encrypted form on our servers to aid in more efficient delivery of additional forwards.</p>
      <p>We offer end-to-end encryption for our Secondary Services. End-to-end encryption means that your messages are
        encrypted to protect against us and third parties from reading them.</p>

        products, or services. If you access a third-party website or service from the Service (for instance attend any
        fitness or sports session hosted on Our Platform but accessible online via third party application or websites)
        or share content on or through any third-party website or service, you do so at your own risk, add you
        understand that this Privacy Policy does not apply to your use of such sites.</p>

        username.</p>

        Primary Services. For example: If you choose to link, create, or log in to your DPS Sports Complex account with
        a payment provider (e.g., Paytm) or social media service (e.g., Facebook), or if you engage with a separate app
        or website that uses Our API (or whose API We use), We may receive information about you or your connections
        from that site or app.</p>
